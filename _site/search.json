    "text": "The NCAA’s new clock rules in football were implemented with a view to shorten games and make the viewer experience more palatable. Have they done that? Let’s take a look within the context of the Big Ten:\n\n\nCode\nsuppressMessages(library(tidyverse))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsuppressMessages(games2022 &lt;- read_csv(\"https://dwillis.github.io/sports-data-files/footballlogs22.csv\"))\nsuppressMessages(games2023 &lt;- read_csv(\"https://dwillis.github.io/sports-data-files/footballlogs23.csv\"))\n\nbig10 &lt;- c(\"Maryland Terrapins\", \"Illinois Fightning Illini\", \"Wisconsin Badgers\", \"Michigan State Spartans\", \"Michigan Wolverines\", \"Indiana Hoosiers\", \"Ohio State Buckeyes\", \"Penn State Nittany Lions\", \"Rutgers Scarlet Knights\", \"Iowa Hawkeyes\", \"Minnesota Golden Gophers\", \"Nebraska Cornhuskers\", \"Northwestern Wildcats\", \"Purdue Boilermakers\")\n\nb10_games2022 &lt;- games2022 |&gt; filter(TeamFull %in% big10)\nb10_games2023 &lt;- games2023 |&gt; filter(TeamFull %in% big10)\n\ngames2022_playsPerGame &lt;- b10_games2022 |&gt; group_by(TeamFull) |&gt; summarize(avgOffPlays = sum(OffensivePlays)/n())\ngames2023_playsPerGame &lt;- b10_games2023 |&gt; group_by(TeamFull) |&gt; summarize(avgOffPlays = sum(OffensivePlays)/n())\n\ngames2022_playsPerGame &lt;- games2022_playsPerGame |&gt; arrange(desc(avgOffPlays))\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=games2022_playsPerGame, \n    aes(x=TeamFull, weight=avgOffPlays)\n  ) +\n  ylab(\"Offensive Plays Per Game\") +\n  xlab(\"Team\") +\n  ggtitle(\"2022 Purdue On Top, but Barely\")+\n  coord_flip() + \n  scale_x_discrete(limits = games2022_playsPerGame$TeamFull[order(games2022_playsPerGame$avgOffPlays)])\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the Big Ten teams in 2022, we can see that the perennial Big Ten powerhouses, like Ohio State and Penn State, weren’t necessarily the ones running the most offensive plays. The bar chart we’ve generated here indicates that Northwestern and Purdue, teams that aren’t known for “running” the Big ten like OSU and Penn State are, might suffer from some sort of offensive inefficiency.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=games2023_playsPerGame, \n    aes(x=TeamFull, weight=avgOffPlays)\n  ) +\n  ylab(\"Offensive Plays Per Game\") +\n  xlab(\"Team\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Penn State Surges Ahead This Year\")+\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_x_discrete(limits = games2023_playsPerGame$TeamFull[order(games2023_playsPerGame$avgOffPlays)])\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, in 2023, Purdue is amongst the top teams in terms of Offensive Plays run per game, and sit at a measly 2-4 on the season.\n\n\nCode\ndifferentials &lt;- data.frame(\n  Team = games2022_playsPerGame$TeamFull,\n  playsPerGame2023 = games2023_playsPerGame$avgOffPlays,\n  playsPerGame2022 = games2022_playsPerGame$avgOffPlays\n)\ndifferentials &lt;- differentials |&gt; mutate(Differential = differentials$playsPerGame2023 - differentials$playsPerGame2022)\n\ndifferentials |&gt; arrange(desc(Differential))\n\n\n                       Team playsPerGame2023 playsPerGame2022 Differential\n1         Wisconsin Badgers         80.60000         63.61538   16.9846154\n2             Iowa Hawkeyes         71.40000         59.38462   12.0153846\n3   Rutgers Scarlet Knights         73.00000         63.50000    9.5000000\n4  Minnesota Golden Gophers         66.50000         66.30769    0.1923077\n5      Nebraska Cornhuskers         62.16667         63.41667   -1.2500000\n6   Michigan State Spartans         62.80000         64.41667   -1.6166667\n7        Maryland Terrapins         67.60000         70.38462   -2.7846154\n8          Indiana Hoosiers         68.33333         73.25000   -4.9166667\n9       Ohio State Buckeyes         62.00000         67.38462   -5.3846154\n10      Michigan Wolverines         63.66667         69.28571   -5.6190476\n11      Purdue Boilermakers         66.40000         74.92857   -8.5285714\n12 Penn State Nittany Lions         59.66667         70.07692  -10.4102564\n13    Northwestern Wildcats         55.50000         73.83333  -18.3333333\n\n\nLooking at the differentials between seasons, the new clock rule intended to shorten games seems to be doing just that – in the Big Ten at least. Of the Big Ten’s teams, just 3 have logged an increased in an average number of plays run per game. Those teams, Penn State, Wisconsin, and Michigan State, are 5-0, 4-1, and 2-3, respectively, indicating that there’s something missing here. What are Penn State and Wisconsin doing differently to only have one loss between them?\n(The Badgers’ one loss was to #19 Washington State by 9 points, a result of falling behind early on in what was otherwise an even matchup on paper)"
