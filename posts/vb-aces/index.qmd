Amongst 327 teams, the Terps roster 4 players who are better than the nation's 75th percentile in Aces per match (~0.71). Of note, two of these players, Sam Csire and Lilly Gunter, contribute over 1 aces per match, indicating strong offensive performance when compared to the nation. With four players in the nation's top ranks, the Terps are sure to be a group no one will take for granted come tournament time in December, should they qualify. For other teams, the Terps could play spoiler to those with major tournament hopes.
